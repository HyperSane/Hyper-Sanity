# Hyper-Sanity (WIP)

Will slowly be converting the HyperSanity reddit here.

As well as pushing obsidian research etc.

This will keep the Future ARG seperate, and yes will be doing the same on the ARG repo.

# Navigating The Repo (WIP)
Since this is a shared-learning experience, I've found that I can sign files seperate from GPG encryption.
Thinking about having just one Signatures folder in every main branch, to prevent dozens of folders.

## PDF's

You can't click the links in pdfs unless you download the PDF, this is a github restriction.
Otherwise you can only see a low-res preview of it from githubs renderer.

## File-Signatures
Files that use .sig are still functional files, they are just signed used GPG to prove authenticity.

To see a files signature, right-click and use GPG/Kleopatra to see signatures.

## GPG

[GPG Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard)

[See the guide from ARG(which is not connected to hyper-sanity, but am referencing it since the guide is universal)](https://github.com/HyperSane/ARG/blob/Main1/ARG%20Guides/Encryption/ARG-GPG%20Guide1.md)

# Obsidian Vault

WIP

Will eventually turn the public vault into a gitsite.
